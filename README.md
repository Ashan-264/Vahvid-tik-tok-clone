# Vahvid - TikTok Clone

This is a clone of TikTok built using Next.js and other modern web technologies. The project serves as a personal endeavor to deepen my skills in full-stack development and to create a functional, scalable web app that mimics the core features of TikTok.

## What I Completed

### 1. **Basic App Setup and Framework Installation**
- Successfully set up a Next.js project using `create-next-app`.
- Installed necessary dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, `next`, and styled components.

### 2. **UI and Layout Design**
- Created basic layouts and component structure.
- Developed reusable components like the homepage feed, video player, and comment section, following TikTok’s UI principles.

### 3. **State Management and Data Fetching**
- Integrated basic state management for handling video data, comments, and likes.
- Implemented dynamic fetching for the video feed and other user interactions.

### 4. **Authentication (In Progress)**
- Began integrating user authentication using Firebase (or any other third-party service you may choose).

## What I Wasn’t Able to Complete

### 1. **Full User Authentication and Session Management**
- Currently, user sign-up, sign-in, and session management are not fully implemented.
- Some authentication-related features are pending, such as secure profile management and email verification.

### 2. **Advanced Video Features**
- Features like video upload, video playback control, and advanced video player customizations are not yet finished.
- The interaction between the video player and other features like likes, comments, and shares is still under development.

### 3. **Styling and Responsiveness**
- Some areas of the app are still in progress in terms of responsiveness, especially on mobile devices.
- I have not yet fully optimized the app for different screen sizes and orientations.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. **Complex CSS Issues**
- During the build process, I faced several issues related to handling CSS with Webpack and Next.js.
- Specific errors included issues with `module is not defined in ES module scope` when importing CSS files and managing styles across components.

### 2. **Dependency and Compatibility Issues**
- Dealing with compatibility issues between different dependencies, especially when upgrading to the latest version of Next.js and related packages.
- Sometimes, updating a dependency caused issues with other parts of the project.

### 3. **Understanding Full-Stack Integration**
- I am still working on fully grasping how to integrate client-side and server-side functionalities in a Next.js app.
- Understanding how to structure an app with Next.js and how to deploy it has been a learning curve.

## How I’m Working on Improving

1. **Continuous Learning and Research**
   - I am reading documentation, looking at tutorials, and studying other successful clones to fill in the gaps in my knowledge.
   - I’m using resources like Next.js documentation, StackOverflow, and other community forums to troubleshoot issues.

2. **Refactoring Code and Debugging**
   - I’m working on improving my code by refactoring certain parts that I initially found too complex or repetitive.
   - I am also troubleshooting and debugging by focusing on one issue at a time and using console logs to help with the debugging process.

3. **Improving Authentication and State Management**
   - I plan to work on implementing a more robust authentication system by following through with Firebase integration.
   - I will be incorporating better state management solutions such as `Redux` or `React Context API` to ensure better app scalability.

4. **Styling and UI Polish**
   - I am planning to go back to the layout and improve the mobile responsiveness by using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid.
   - I’m also looking to incorporate design patterns like Atomic Design for better UI consistency.

## Future Goals

- **Video Upload & Playback**: Implement functionality to allow users to upload videos and have advanced playback features like skipping, pausing, and buffering.
- **User Profile Pages**: Develop and complete user profile pages, including the ability to upload a profile picture and edit personal information.
- **Interactive Features**: Add features like following users, viewing the following feed, and liking or sharing videos.
- **Deployment**: I aim to deploy the app to production, using platforms like Vercel or Netlify, and make the app accessible to the public.

## Conclusion

This project has been an amazing learning experience, allowing me to develop both front-end and back-end skills. Although there are some features I was not able to complete, I am continuing to refine my skills and overcome the challenges I encountered. This project is still in development, and I am committed to completing it with more robust features and a polished UI.
